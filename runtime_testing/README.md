1. `triadsim_runtimes.out` and `regens_runtime.out` were acquired by running `triadsim_main.sh` and `regens_main.sh` respectively. 

2. Running `triadsim_runtimes.py` extracts the runtimes and max RAM usage values
from `triadsim_runtimes.out` and `regens_runtime.out` to compute to compute bootstrapped confidence intervals.

3. All processors on hosts lambda10 through lambda19 are all identical to the best of our knowledge.
