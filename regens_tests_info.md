There are four testing folders:
1. correctness_testing_ACB
2. correctness_testing_GBR
3. runtime_testing
4. unit_testing_files

The tests in "correctness_testing_ACB" and "correctness_testing_GBR" ensure that the most important parts of the regens algorithm work correctly for two different samples.
